# witcher3-maya-animation
These Maya tools allow the creation of json files that describe Witcher 3 animations. [Wolven-kit](https://github.com/Traderain/Wolven-kit) can then be used to import the json animations into Witcher 3 formats.

In particular you can : 
- Import and export w2anims.json (bone and track animation)
- Import and export w2cutscene.json (multipart bone and track animation that describe full cutscenes) (in progress)
- Import and export w2rig.json (skeletons)
- Import and export w3fac.json (face skeleton and face pose library) (in progress)
